                <h1>Troubleshooting your Whirlpool products</h1>
                <h2>Common problems with household appliances</h2>
                <p>Many types of problems can occur with both large and small household appliances. Some issues can simply result from extended use over a period of months or years. Specific parts of your kitchen appliances may wear out over time, especially if an item is used daily for many months. Dishwashers can develop broken seals and leaks over time. On the other hand, refrigerators and freezers can sometimes begin to develop problems maintaining a specific internal temperature. No matter what the issue is, you'll need access to manufacturer-approved Whirlpool parts to make the necessary repairs to your appliances.</p>
