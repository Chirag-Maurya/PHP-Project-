                <h1>Troubleshooting Craftsman tools</h1>
                <p>Craftsman chainsaws—Craftsman chainsaws are known for delivering power, but if your tool won't start, the problem may be a bad spark plug. If the chainsaw stalls on you, you might need to rebuild or replace the carburettor.</p>
                <p>String trimmer—The string trimmer is a valuable tool for any yard, but if yours won't start it may be due to a clogged carburettor. You may need to replace the carburettor. In some cases, a carburettor repair kit can do the trick. If the head won't stop spinning on your line trimmer when you release the trigger, the problem is likely caused by a bad clutch.</p>
                <p>Circular saw—Craftsman is known for their circular saws. If yours won't run, check the motor brushes for visible signs of damage. These can wear out, inhibiting the operation of the saw.</p>
                <h2>Common Craftsman air compressor replacement parts</h2>
                <p>•	Check valve—The check valve prevents air from flowing back into the pump when the motor isn't running. A common sign it needs to be replaced is when the air compressor won't start when the air tank is full but it will start when the air tank is empty.</p>
                <p>•	Air tubes—If the pressure is low or you can hear air leaking when the compressor isn't running, then you may need to replace the air tubes.</p>
                <p>•	Air compressor tank—The tank itself can rust if condensation collects inside when it's not running, causing holes where air can leak. Unplug the air compressor and bleed air out of the tank before replacing the air tank.</p>
                <p>•	Drive belt—If your air compressor is making a shrill sound when it's running, then the drive belt likely needs to be replaced..</p>
