"It can be a very useful tool especially in smaller towns in our country owing to lack of easy access to CT scans," said the developers.</p>

                    <p>IBM has unveiled what it claims to be world's first 2-nanometre chipmaking technology. The technology could be 45% faster than 7-nanometre chips used in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, according to the company. As many as 50 billion transistors can be fit into a chip the size of a fingernail, IBM added.</p>
