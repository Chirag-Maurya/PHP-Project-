                <h1>Repairing your LG appliances</h1>
                <h2>Depending on what appliance(s) you're working with, you may be facing one or more of the following issues:</h2>
                <p>Issue #1: Your LG plasma TV is overheating—Like many consumer electronics, LG plasma TVs are equipped with cooling fans to prevent overheating. If your TV is running hot, it may need a new module fan.</p>
                <p>Issue #2: Your LG AC unit only pumps cool air for a short time if at all—This issue can point to many different causes, but one of the more common culprits is the evaporator thermistor. This sensor is responsible for detecting temperatures and communicating with the control board. If it isn't working properly, accurate temperature modulation is impossible.</p>
                <p>Issue #3: Your refrigerator is running too cold, or food is spoiling—If your fridge is having temperature issues, it may be time for a new defrost sensor, which monitors the temperature of the evaporator coil and transmits temperature readings.</p>
                <h2>Simple tricks to get your LG dishwasher working again</h2>
                <p>Dishwashers are reliable machines, but after a while, they can start to have some issues, usually indicated by an error code. Some of these issues are simple enough to fix yourself with a DIY process. Start with these troubleshooting tips.</p>
                <p>Water level—Your LG dishwasher will send you an error code when water levels aren't normal. It may be due to a dirty filter or a supply valve that isn't opening all the way. Try replacing your filter and fully opening the supply valve; this could solve the problem.</p>
                <p>Door latch—If your dishwasher isn't turning on, it could mean that your door isn't latching all the way. Each door has a fail-safe that prevents the dishwasher from running if the door isn't shut all the way.</p>
